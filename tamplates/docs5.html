            <p>I <span class="bold">{{data.name2}}, {{dat.occupation}} and marital status of {{data.spouse}}</span> of <span class="bold">{{address2}}</span> in the Island of
                Trinidad, make oath and say as follows:</p>

            <p>
                1. That I desire to obtain Letters of Administration in the estate of <span class="bold">{{data.descr1}}</span> (hereinafter called "the Deceased"),
                who died at <span class="bold">{{data.descr2}}</span>  on the <span class="bold">{{data.descr3}}</span>  <span class="bold">{{data.descr4}}</span>  having a fixed place of abode at
                <span class="bold">{{data.descr5}}</span> . The Deceased is the same person as <span class="bold">{{data.descr6}}</span>  named in the Death Certificate hereto annexed and
                marked "<span class="bold">{{data.descr7}}</span>". I am over the age of 18 years.
            </p>
            <p>2. I am applying in my capacity as the <span class="bold">{{data.descr8}}</span> of the deceased.</p>

            <p>3.
                The deceased at the time of his death was <span class="bold">{{data.descr9}}</span>.
            </p>
            
            <h2>THIS FORM IS A GUIDE. IT DOES NOT REPLACE THE FORMS IN THE WILLS AND
                PROBATE ACT</h2>

            <p>4.
                The deceased and I were married on the <span class="bold">{{data.descr10}}</span> at <span class="bold">{{data.descr11}}</span> and we
are the same persons referred to as <span class="bold">{{data.descr12}}</span>
and <span class="bold">{{data.descr13}}</span>. The marriage certificate is hereto
annexed and marked "<span class="bold">{{data.descr14}}</span>".</p>

            <p>5. Shortly after the death of the deceased I made (or caused to be made) diligent search
                among the papers and effects of the deceased and also in the depository for Wills of living
                persons in the Registry of the Supreme Court for a Will or other document of a
                testamentary character of the deceased and found none and verily believe that the
                deceased died intestate.</p>

            <p>6. From searches made in the said Registry it appears that no application for probate or
                administration has been made previous to this application. <span class="bold">{{data.descr15}}</span>.</p>

            <p>7. The reason for the delay in filing the application is due to <span class="bold">{{data.descr16}}</span>.</p>

            <p>8. I will duly get in and administer the estate of the said Deceased and pay the Deceasedâ€™s
                just debts and distribute the rest of his estate according to law.</p>

            <p>9. I will file in the Registry within 12 calendar months from the date of the grant a
                statement and account verified by my affidavit of my administration of the estate of the
                Deceased.</p>

            <p>10. The statements in the application annexed hereto are true to the best of my knowledge,
                information and belief.</p>

            <p>11. The Inventory hereto annexed and marked "<span class="bold">{{data.descr17}}</span>" is a true inventory of
                the particulars of the estate of the Deceased and the value of all the real and personal
                estate and effects of the Deceased for and in respect of which a grant is required and is
                exclusive of what the Deceased may have been possessed of and entitled to as trustee for
                any other person or persons and not beneficially, and is also exclusive of the property in
                the said inventory specified as being incapable of immediate valuation. The gross value
                as at the date of death thereof altogether is <span class="bold">{{data.descr18}}</span> as set out in
                the Inventory to the best of my knowledge, information and belief.</p>
            <h2>THIS FORM IS A GUIDE. IT DOES NOT REPLACE THE FORMS IN THE WILLS AND

                <p>12. The letters of administration is required in the names of the deceased as <span class="bold">{{data.descr19}}</span> and in the name of the applicant as <span class="bold">{{data.descr20}}</span>.</p>
