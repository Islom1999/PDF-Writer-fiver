        <p>15.	I will file in the Registry within 12 calendar months from the date of the grant a statement and account verified by my affidavit of my administration of the estate of the Deceased.</p>


        <p>16.	The statements in the application annexed hereto are true to the best of my knowledge, information and belief.</p>


        <p>
            17.	The Inventory hereto annexed and marked <span class="bold">{{data.descr62}}</span>. is a true inventory of the particulars of the estate of the Deceased and the value of all the real and personal estate and effects of the Deceased for and in respect of which a grant is required and is exclusive of what the Deceased may have been possessed of and entitled to as trustee for any other person or persons and not beneficially, and is also exclusive of the property in the said inventory specified as being incapable of immediate valuation. The gross value as at the date of death thereof altogether is <span class="bold">{{data.descr63}}</span> as set out in the Inventory to the best of my knowledge, information and belief.
